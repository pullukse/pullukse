My name is Seray. I am a second year Master of Information student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. I am a skilled data analyst, previously worked at organizations like the [University of Toronto](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/), [Bank of Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank), [Ashoka Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_(non-profit_organization)), and [MaRS Discovery District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaRS_Discovery_District). I aim to grow into data science, more specifically bioinformatics protein modelling.

I am from [Istanbul, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul) ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· but have been living in [Toronto, ON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ since 2010. I love watching movies at [TIFF](https://tiff.net/) and check out new restaurants. Feel free to connect with me via GitHub or LinkedIn!
